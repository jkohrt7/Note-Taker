## Description
Note Taker is a full-stack application that allows users to post and remove notes or reminders. 

## Installation
The project is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://jk-crud-note-taker.herokuapp.com/notes) if you don't want to install the app locally.

To install the project locally, you'll need [Node.js](nodejs.org). Once Node is installed, download the repo and open the folder in a command line interface. 
The command ```npm -i``` will install all the dependencies; afterwards, use ```node server.js``` to start the server. 

The front end of the website can then be accessed in a web browser at the domain localhost:3000.

## Usage
The landing page only servers as a greeting; click 'Get Started' to go to the notes page, which contains the main application.

The 'notes' section of the application has three main features. Entering a title and description into the text inputs on the right will add them to a list that appears in the left-hand column. These notes can be opened by clicking on them, or they can be deleted by clicking on the trash can icons.
